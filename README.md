# RTO-Driven Flash Deals Notification System

## 🚀 Overview

The Flash Deals Notification System is an innovative solution that transforms order cancellations from a cost center into a revenue opportunity. When a customer cancels an order, instead of shipping the item back to the warehouse (incurring return costs), our system identifies nearby users who might be interested in the product and offers them a flash deal at a discounted price.

This approach creates a win-win-win scenario:
- **For the company**: Reduced return shipping costs and new sales opportunities
- **For customers**: Access to discounted products they've shown interest in
- **For the environment**: Fewer unnecessary shipments and reduced carbon footprint

## 🏗️ Architecture

Our system implements a modern, scalable architecture using the following technologies:

- **PostgreSQL**: For persistent data storage (users, products, orders, interests, flash deals)
- **Redis**: For rate limiting and caching
- **Bull MQ**: For reliable message queuing (implementing the outbox pattern)
- **Express.js**: For API endpoints and server logic
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time notifications
- **React**: For the frontend user interface
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For containerization and easy deployment
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: For push notifications and mobile-friendly experience

## 🔄 System Flow

1. **Order Cancellation**: User cancels an order, triggering the process
2. **Event Publishing**: System updates order status and publishes a cancellation event
3. **User Matching**: Background worker identifies nearby interested users based on:
- Same/similar product category
- Geographic proximity (pincode-based)
- Recent interaction with the category (within 14 days)
4. **Rate Limiting**: System checks if users have received similar notifications recently
5. **Pricing Calculation**: 
- Calculates return shipping cost savings
- Creates discount based on 75% of these savings
- Ensures price doesn't fall below minimum threshold
6. **Flash Deal Creation**: Creates time-limited deals (2 days) for matched users
7. **Notification**: Sends real-time notifications via Socket.IO and PWA
8. **Purchase Flow**: Users can view and purchase flash deals through the app

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flash-deals-notification-system.git
cd flash-deals-notification-system
```

2. Install server dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

3. Install client dependencies:
```bash
cd ../Client
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the server directory with the following variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/meesho
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
PORT=5000
```

### Running the Application

#### Quick Start (Recommended)

We've provided a convenience script that handles everything for you:

**Windows:**
```bash
cd server
.\reset-and-start.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd server
chmod +x reset-and-start.sh
./reset-and-start.sh
```

This script will:
1. Stop any running Node.js processes
2. Bring down Docker containers
3. Remove Docker volumes
4. Start Docker containers
5. Initialize the database with schema and mock data
6. Start the server

#### Manual Setup

If you prefer to run commands individually:

1. Start Docker containers:
```bash
cd server
docker compose up -d
```

2. Initialize the database:
```bash
node setup-db.js
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
node index.js
```

4. In a separate terminal, start the client:
```bash
cd Client
npm start
```

## 🧪 Testing the Application

The application comes with pre-configured mock data for testing:

1. **User 1 (Mumbai)**: Can cancel orders
- Access at: http://localhost:3000/
- Order ID: 55555555-5555-5555-5555-555555555555

2. **User 2 (Delhi)**: Receives flash deal notifications
- Access at: http://localhost:3000/user2

### Testing Flow

1. Open two browser windows side by side
2. In window 1, open User 1's page and cancel an order
3. In window 2, observe User 2 receiving a flash deal notification
4. Click on the notification to view the flash deal details
