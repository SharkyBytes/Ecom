# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a frontend-only three-page web application for Meesho's flash sale redirect service. The system demonstrates how cancelled orders can be instantly offered to nearby interested customers as flash sales. Page 1 shows User 1 with their order details and cancellation capability, while Pages 2 and 3 show User 2 and User 3 respectively with their user data, both receiving simultaneous flash sale notifications when User 1 cancels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As User 1 (the cancelling customer), I want to access my page via the root URL and view my user data and order details with a cancel button, so that I can cancel my order when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to localhost:3000/ (root URL) THEN the system SHALL display User 1's page with user data, complete order details including product category, and a prominent cancel button
2. WHEN User 1 clicks the cancel button THEN the system SHALL immediately trigger flash sale notifications on Pages 2 and 3 simultaneously across all open browser tabs
3. WHEN the cancellation is processed THEN the system SHALL update Page 1 to show the order has been cancelled

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As User 2 (potential flash sale customer), I want to access my page via a specific URL and see my user data initially and receive instant flash sale notifications, so that I can purchase cancelled items at discounted prices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to localhost:3000/user2 THEN the system SHALL display User 2's page with User 2's data and profile information
2. WHEN User 1 cancels an order on Page 1 THEN the system SHALL simultaneously display a flash sale notification on Page 2 with product details and discounted price
3. WHEN User 2 clicks "Buy Now" THEN the system SHALL process the purchase, show success confirmation, and remove the flash sale from Page 3 across all browser tabs
4. WHEN User 3 purchases the item first THEN the system SHALL remove the flash sale notification from Page 2

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As User 3 (potential flash sale customer), I want to access my page via a specific URL and see my user data initially and receive instant flash sale notifications, so that I can compete for cancelled items at discounted prices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to localhost:3000/user3 THEN the system SHALL display User 3's page with User 3's data and profile information
2. WHEN User 1 cancels an order on Page 1 THEN the system SHALL simultaneously display the same flash sale notification on Page 3 as shown on Page 2
3. WHEN User 3 clicks "Buy Now" first THEN the system SHALL process the purchase, show success confirmation, and remove the flash sale from Page 2 across all browser tabs
4. WHEN User 2 purchases the item first THEN the system SHALL remove the flash sale notification from Page 3 and show "Item no longer available" message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the three-page application, I want consistent styling and real-time synchronization across all pages, so that I have a seamless flash sale experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access any of the three pages THEN the system SHALL display content using #b282a4 color for headings, black for normal text, and white background
2. WHEN I use the application on any device THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive PWA experience built with Create React App and Tailwind CSS
3. WHEN User 1 cancels an order THEN the system SHALL update Pages 2 and 3 simultaneously without page refreshes
4. WHEN either User 2 or User 3 purchases a flash sale item THEN the system SHALL immediately update the other user's page to reflect the item is no longer available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer preparing for backend integration, I want the frontend to simulate real-time behavior across multiple browser tabs, so that I can later connect it to actual backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the three pages THEN the system SHALL use React Router for URL-based navigation (/, /user2, /user3) and localStorage/sessionStorage for cross-tab communication
2. WHEN a cancellation or purchase occurs in one browser tab THEN the system SHALL update all other open tabs in real-time using browser storage events
3. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL structure components and data handling to facilitate easy backend API integration
4. WHEN testing the application THEN the system SHALL allow opening localhost:3000/, localhost:3000/user2, and localhost:3000/user3 in separate tabs to simulate three different users
